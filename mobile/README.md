In the first run, execute mca-initialize.sh

If you want to rebuild the entire mobile project, just remove platforms/, merges/ and plugins/ directories and run mca-initialize.sh again.

Please, don't make any custom changes to platforms/, merges/ or plugins/ directories, since they are assets created by the build project. Instead, make your changes in www/ and ../plugins directories.
